      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>

				<figcaption>
					This NYPD precinct map highlights the distribution of arrest complaints against officers from 2000 to 2019, color-coded by the most frequently reported officer ethnicity in each area.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				When building the chart, I utilized data from New York City OpenData 
				(available at data.cityofnewyork.us) to get information about police 
				precinct borders. I downloaded the geographic data as a geojson file 
				that can be used in Tableau. This file allowed me to depict each NYPD 
				precinct on a map, giving a clear picture of where each one is. To 
				display the number of complaints against officers, I colored each 
				precinct based on the ethnicity reported most often within that area. 
				This gave me a  better visual understanding of which ethnicities are 
				most often connected to complaints in different parts of the city.

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>Color coding by most common officer ethnicity per precinct</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Score: -1.5</li>
						<li>This decision visually emphasizes the prevalence of white officers across precincts without providing context regarding the actual numbers or proportions relative to other ethnicities. It uses color effectively to suggest a majority.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Exclusion of headcount data in visualization</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Score: -2</li>
						<li>By not adjusting for the number of officers within each ethnicity and precinct, the chart exaggerates the representation of white officers, which can mislead viewers about the frequency of allegations against them. This lack of context is a significant factor in the deceptive quality of the visualization, as there are proportionally more white officers than any other ethnicity.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Choice of map as visualization format</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Score: -1</li>
						<li>Maps are persuasive because they provide a spatial context to the data. In this case, using a map to show allegations can mislead the viewer into assuming spatial trends and correlations where the data may not support them. Viewers might misinterpret the color distribution (predominantly red) as a reflection of actual complaint rates across different areas.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Not taking population in each precinct into account</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Score: -0.5</li>
						<li>This map presents each precinct as equally weighted regardless of the actual population. High population areas are naturally more likely to have a higher number of interactions with police, which can lead to more complaints. The decision to not normalize the data presents a misleading view, suggesting that precincts are comparable one-to-one in terms of complaint frequency. This could mislead viewers into drawing incorrect conclusions about the distribution and frequency of allegations against officers.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Choice of color</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Score: -0.5</li>
						<li>The use of color is critical in map visualization as it conveys the density of data points. In this case, red, which is often associated with danger or attention, is assigned to the white ethnicity. This could subconsciously signal to the viewer that the precincts with a majority of white officers are areas of higher concern, which plays into the deceptive narrative.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
