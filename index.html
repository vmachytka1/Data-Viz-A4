      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>

				<figcaption>
					This NYPD precinct map highlights the distribution of arrest complaints against officers from 2000 to 2019, color-coded by the most frequently reported officer ethnicity in each area.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				When building the chart, I utilized data from New York City OpenData 
				(available at data.cityofnewyork.us) to get information about police 
				precinct borders. I downloaded the geographic data as a geojson file 
				that can be used in Tableau. This file allowed me to depict each NYPD 
				precinct on a map, giving a clear picture of where each one is. To 
				display the number of complaints against officers, I colored each 
				precinct based on the ethnicity reported most often within that area. 
				This gave me a  better visual understanding of which ethnicities are 
				most often connected to complaints in different parts of the city.

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>Color coding by most common officer ethnicity per precinct</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Score: -1.5</li>
						<li>This decision visually emphasizes the prevalence of white officers across precincts without providing context regarding the actual numbers or proportions relative to other ethnicities. It uses color effectively to suggest a majority.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Exclusion of headcount data in visualization</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Score: -2</li>
						<li>By not adjusting for the number of officers within each ethnicity and precinct, the chart exaggerates the representation of white officers, which can mislead viewers about the frequency of allegations against them. This lack of context is a significant factor in the deceptive quality of the visualization, as there are proportionally more white officers than any other ethnicity.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Choice of map as visualization format</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Score: -1</li>
						<li>Maps are persuasive because they provide a spatial context to the data. In this case, using a map to show allegations can mislead the viewer into assuming spatial trends and correlations where the data may not support them. Viewers might misinterpret the color distribution (predominantly red) as a reflection of actual complaint rates across different areas.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Not taking population in each precinct into account</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Score: -0.5</li>
						<li>This map presents each precinct as equally weighted regardless of the actual population. High population areas are naturally more likely to have a higher number of interactions with police, which can lead to more complaints. The decision to not normalize the data presents a misleading view, suggesting that precincts are comparable one-to-one in terms of complaint frequency. This could mislead viewers into drawing incorrect conclusions about the distribution and frequency of allegations against officers.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Choice of color</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Score: -0.5</li>
						<li>The use of color is critical in map visualization as it conveys the density of data points. In this case, red, which is often associated with danger or attention, is assigned to the white ethnicity. This could subconsciously signal to the viewer that the precincts with a majority of white officers are areas of higher concern, which plays into the deceptive narrative.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

          BRIEF CAPTION HERE.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				To create the truthful chart, I wanted a more accurate way to look at allegations over time and across officer ethnicities. Therefore, I downloaded the NYPD headcount data (available at nyc.gov) to figure out how many officers there were of each ethnicity. With this, I created a calculation in Tableau to determine the "allegation rate per officer." To do this correctly, I used a FIXED level of detail expression to calculate my rate separately for each ethnicity and each year.
			</p>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<strong>Normalizing complaint rates by officer headcount</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Score: 2</li>
						<li>This chart normalizes the data by showing the arrest allegation rate per officer, based on each officer's ethnicity, across different years. By calculating the rate of complaints, the visualization accurately reflects the likelihood of complaints against officers of different ethnicities, thereby providing a comparison that corrects the deceptive narrative suggested by the raw numbers.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Consistent color scheme with deceptive chart</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Score: 1.5</li>
						<li>Using the same color scheme as in the deceptive chart maintains consistency, allowing viewers to easily compare and contrast the two charts. This helps in reinforcing the correction of the narrative when viewers see the difference between the raw counts and the normalized rates.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Use of bar charts for easy comparison</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Score: 2</li>
						<li>Bar charts are effective for comparing quantities and make it easier to see differences in rates between ethnicities across years. This choice helps highlighting the actual disparity in complaints, clearly showing that minority officers are accused at disproportionately higher rates than white officers.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Clear display of trends over time</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Score: 2</li>
						<li>The layout allows for the comparison of trends over time, demonstrating whether the allegation rates are increasing or decreasing for each ethnicity. The clarity ensures the viewer can draw accurate conclusions from the data over time.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Citywide aggregation instead of precinct-level analysis</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Score: 1.5</li>
						<li>The decision to aggregate the data for the entire city, rather than breaking it down by precinct, avoids misleading localized patterns and instead provides a broader, more generalized view of complaint rates. This eliminates the potential noise of precinct-specific factors like variable officer deployment sizes or differing neighborhood demographics. As a result, this approach promotes a citywide overview rather than attributing issues to specific precincts.</li>
