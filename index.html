			<p>
				When building the chart, I utilized data from New York City OpenData 
				(available at data.cityofnewyork.us) to get information about police 
				precinct borders. I downloaded the geographic data as a geojson file 
				that can be used in Tableau. This file allowed me to depict each NYPD 
				precinct on a map, giving a clear picture of where each one is. To 
				display the number of complaints against officers, I colored each 
				precinct based on the ethnicity reported most often within that area. 
				This gave me a  better visual understanding of which ethnicities are 
				most often connected to complaints in different parts of the city.

				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					Color Coding by Most Common Officer Ethnicity per Precinct
					<ul>
						<li>Score: -1.5</li>
						<li>This decision visually emphasizes the prevalence of white officers across precincts without providing context regarding the actual numbers or proportions relative to other ethnicities. It uses color effectively to suggest a majority.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
